    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken breast recipe with mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and herbs is a true tried-and-tested recipe! I remember seeing an ad on TV about cooking with mayonnaise and decided to give it a shot. I've made it with just the mayonnaise on top and it really locks the moisture into the chicken. The bread crumbs and cheese are a must for me; they complement each other very well.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons bread crumbs, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons herbes de Provence</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place chicken breasts in a baking pan.</li>
        <li>Mix Parmesan cheese and mayonnaise together in a bowl until well combined; spread evenly over chicken breasts. Coat with bread crumbs and sprinkle with herbes de Provence.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
