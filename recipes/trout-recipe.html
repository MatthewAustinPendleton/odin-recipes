    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This trout recipe is so simple, it doesn't even have a name. I just call it Trout. This is such an easy weeknight seafood dinner. It's a really nice way to cook fish, especially if you're new at cooking it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Â¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) whole trout, butterflied and deboned</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat until butter smells toasted and is golden brown, about 1 minute. Turn off heat.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with a piece of aluminum foil. Place trout onto foil; open trout so skin sides are down. Drizzle each trout with about 1/2 teaspoon melted butter. Generously season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Move an oven rack to 5 or 6 inches below the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler on high heat.</li>
        <li>Broil trout until opaque and barely firm to the touch, 2 or 3 minutes. Remove from oven.</li>
        <li>Return pan of remaining melted butter over high heat; stir in lemon juice and parsley. Bring butter sauce to a boil; whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Serve trout on plates and drizzle with butter sauce.</li>
    </ol>
