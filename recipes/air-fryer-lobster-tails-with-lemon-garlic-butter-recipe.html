    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Air fry lobster tails for an elegant meal for two at home. They come out succulent and meaty. Delicious with lemony garlic butter and parsley.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (4 ounce) lobster tails</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, grated</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 wedges lemon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat an air fryer to 380 degrees F (195 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Butterfly lobster tails by cutting lengthwise through the centers of the hard top shells and meat with kitchen shears. Cut to, but not through, the bottoms of the shells.</li>
        <li>Spread tail halves apart. Place tails in the air fryer basket with lobster meat facing up.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add lemon zest and garlic; heat until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Transfer 2 tablespoons of butter mixture to a small bowl; brush this onto lobster tails. Discard any remaining brushed butter to avoid contamination from uncooked lobster. Season lobster with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer until lobster meat is opaque, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon reserved butter from the saucepan over lobster meat. Top with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
