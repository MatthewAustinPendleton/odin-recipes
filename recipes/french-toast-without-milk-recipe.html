    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This French toast without milk is perfect for those who like a more solid French toast. My son's friends really liked this and would ask for the recipe to take home for their moms to make! Serve with butter and syrup.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white or brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 slices white bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a wide mixing bowl; mix in sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Dip 2 slices of bread into egg mixture, ensuring both sides are covered; place in the skillet and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
